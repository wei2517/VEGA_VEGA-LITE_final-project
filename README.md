# Vega

Use [*Vega*](https://vega.github.io/vega/) to make a statistic map.

## Motivation
For my final project, i choose *Vega*,a free,statistical, and visualized software to learn. The reason is that i am contacting with a plan for community redevelopment currently.Therefore,the purpose for this project is to make a statistic map for the community intergration. Besides,a visualization grammar is also an useful tool  to make the unified graphics for my research in the future.

## Feature
* Data visualization.
* A declarative language for describing visualizations.
( include the data transformations and visual encoding rules needed to express a rich space of visualizations. )
* A convenient means for writing programs that generate visualizations, ranging from interactive design tools to automatic chart recommendation tools. 

## VEGA VS VEGA-LITE?
*VEGA: A visualization grammar, a declarative language for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs.
*VEGA-LITE: Vega-Lite is a high-level grammar of interactive graphics. It provides a concise JSON syntax for rapidly generating visualizations to support analysis.

## Purpose
1. Draw a map around Yintong community.
2. Use VEGA-LITE to make the plots that connect to my own project in BME.

## Process
### Map:
1.Put the raw data of West Central Dist., Tainan City into VEGA-LITE.(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jason2506/Taiwan.TopoJSON/master/topojson/villages/villages-67000370.json)
2.Use VEGA-LITE program to change the feature that you want.
3.Use Vega-Lite Block to embed the figure to the web.
4.Achievement: (https://bl.ocks.org/wei2517/raw/50f0c2bbf8420009a470fb0500a5a79f/20b5436a06f5f20ebc255619d3298faffbf1e897/)
5.Because there is no raw data for the name of the villages, I use "小畫家" to key the name on the map(.png).
